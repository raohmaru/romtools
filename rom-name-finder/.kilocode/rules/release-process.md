# When preparing releases

- Follow semantic versioning strictly (see versioning.md)
- Update version in both frontend and backend `package.json`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes since last release
- Test thoroughly in staging before production
- Create git tags for all releases
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Create migration guides for major releases
- Verify database migrations work correctly
- Communicate releases to stakeholders
- Keep release notes user-friendly and clear

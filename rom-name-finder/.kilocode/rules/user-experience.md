# User Experience Guidelines

This document outlines the user experience principles and guidelines for the React application.

## UX Principles

1. **Clarity**: Interface should be self-explanatory. Use clear labels, helpful hints, and intuitive navigation. Avoid jargon and technical terms where possible.

2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent patterns across the application. Use the same components, interactions, and visual language throughout.

3. **Efficiency**: Minimize steps to complete tasks. Provide shortcuts, auto-save, and smart defaults. Reduce cognitive load.

4. **Feedback**: Always provide feedback for user actions. Show loading states, success messages, and error messages clearly and promptly.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is usable by everyone, including users with disabilities. Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript. Enhanced features improve the experience for capable browsers.

## Design System

Use CSS Modules in React for scoped styling for component modularity to ensure consistency.

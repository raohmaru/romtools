## Architecture Principles

- **Type Safety First**: Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time, avoid `any` types, use strict mode
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build reusable, composable React components following single responsibility principle
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between presentation (React), business logic (services), and data access (repositories)
- **API-First Design**: Backend APIs are designed independently of frontend, enabling future mobile apps or third-party integrations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with React for better UX
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

#  When generating code

- Follow the architectural principles outlined here
- Ensure components align with the system architecture
- Use TypeScript types consistently across frontend and backend
- Follow the project structure - place files in appropriate directories
- Reference related architecture documents for specific domains
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use the repository pattern for all data access
- Implement proper error handling at each layer

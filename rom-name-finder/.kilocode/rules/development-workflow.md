# When developing features

- Always start from `develop` branch (except hotfixes)
- Use descriptive branch names following conventions
- Write clear commit messages using conventional commits
- Run tests and linting before pushing
- Create PRs early for early feedback
- Keep PRs focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation when needed
- Follow code review feedback
- Ensure CI/CD passes before merging
- Delete branches after merge
